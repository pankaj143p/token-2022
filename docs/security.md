# Security Considerations

## Transfer Hook Validation

### Whitelisting Strategy
- Only pre-approved hook programs are allowed
- Hook programs undergo security review before approval
- Whitelist is managed by pool authority
- Emergency pause mechanism for suspicious activity

### Pre-transaction Simulation
- All transfers are simulated before execution
- Hook validation runs in simulation environment
- Failed simulations prevent actual transaction
- Protects against hook execution failures

### Hook Program Requirements
- Must implement standard transfer hook interface
- Should include proper error handling
- Must not have infinite loops or excessive computation
- Should validate all input parameters

## AMM Security

### Liquidity Protection
- Minimum liquidity requirements prevent dust attacks
- LP token burn prevents liquidity drainage
- Pool authority controls for emergency situations
- Fee collection limits to prevent exploitation

### Price Manipulation Prevention
- Constant product formula provides fair pricing
- Slippage protection for all trades
- Flash loan protection through transaction checks
- MEV protection through randomized execution

### Access Controls
- Pool authority has limited permissions
- Hook whitelist requires authority approval
- Configuration changes have timelock (future enhancement)
- Multi-signature support for critical operations

## Smart Contract Auditing

### Code Review Checklist
- [ ] All arithmetic operations checked for overflow
- [ ] Access controls properly implemented
- [ ] Error handling covers all edge cases
- [ ] No reentrancy vulnerabilities
- [ ] Proper account validation
- [ ] Secure randomness if needed

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for all instructions
- Integration tests for complex flows
- Fuzzing tests for edge cases
- Load testing for performance
- Security-focused test scenarios

## Frontend Security

### Wallet Integration
- Secure wallet adapter usage
- Transaction signing best practices
- No private key exposure
- Secure connection to RPC endpoints

### Input Validation
- All user inputs sanitized
- Amount limits enforced
- Address validation for all pubkeys
- Rate limiting for API calls

## Deployment Security

### Program Deployment
- Immutable program deployment on mainnet
- Upgrade authority carefully managed
- Buffer accounts properly secured
- Reproducible builds for verification

### Infrastructure Security
- Secure RPC endpoint configuration
- HTTPS enforcement for all connections
- Regular security updates
- Monitoring and alerting systems

## Emergency Procedures

### Incident Response
1. Pause affected pools immediately
2. Assess impact and scope
3. Communicate with users transparently
4. Implement fix and test thoroughly
5. Resume operations with enhanced monitoring

### Recovery Mechanisms
- Pool pause functionality
- Emergency withdrawal procedures
- User fund protection protocols
- Clear communication channels
